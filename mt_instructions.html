	    <p>
	    You will be shown an image.  The task is to outline an
	    unlabeled object and to
	    provide a text description of the object.
	    Note that
	    previously labeled objects may appear on the image.
	    Please do not label previously labeled objects.
<!--	    <font color="red">Please do not label previously labeled objects as you will not receive credit.</font>-->
	    The HIT is
	    completed once you have
	    annotated the required number of objects.
	  </p>
	  <p>The following steps describe how to label an object:</p>

	  <p>
	  1. Start by pressing the left
          mouse button at some point along the boundary of the object.
	  <br />2. Continue clicking along the boundary of the object
          to create a polygon.
	  <br />3. Once you have finished
          clicking along the boundary of the object, either click on
          the first point or press the right mouse button to complete
          the polygon.
	  <br />4. A window will now appear asking for the object's
          name.  Enter the object's name and click the "Done" button.
	  </p>

	  <!--
        <p><strong>Create polygon: </strong>To start a polygon, press the left
          mouse button at some point along the boundary of the object.
           Continue clicking along the boundary of the object.</p>
        <p><strong>Close polygon: </strong>Once you have finished
          clicking along the boundary of the object, either click on
          the first point or press the right mouse button to complete
          the polygon. A window will appear asking
          for the object's name.  Try to use common and
          short names to describe the object. Example object names: sky,
          tree, building, road, sidewalk, person, car, chair.  </p>

        <p>The following are some recomendations for how to provide annotations
          that are as useful as possible. </p>
	  <p><strong>View the entire image: </strong> Make sure that
	  your browser occupies the entire screen and that you scroll
	  to see the entire image.  If you label an object on the edge
	  of your browser, make sure to scroll so that the entire
	  object is visible.
	  </p>
        <p><strong>Follow the object outline: </strong> Click on top of the object
          boundary so that the polygon accurately delineates the object outline.
          The ideal outline should be good enough for somebody to recognize the
          object just by seeing the drawn polygon.</p>
        <p><strong>Labeling occluded objects: </strong>Sometimes objects will
          be only partially visible. This is especially true for regions like roads,
          buildings, etc., which become difficult to label when there are many occlusions.
          We recommend in these cases to complete the boundary as if they were not
          occluded. </p>
        <p><strong>Object naming: </strong>Use common English names for objects.
          Use a name that you think other people are likely to use to describe
          the same object. You can use several words to describe an
          object.
	  Example object names: sky,
          tree, building, road, sidewalk, person, car, chair.	  </p>

    <tr>
      <td><p><font size="5">Advanced features</font></p>
        <p><strong>Delete segments: </strong>If you want to delete one segment
          of the polygon before finishing the polygon, press the <code>delete</code>
          key. Once the polygon is closed, you can not delete control points or
          add new segments, but you can modify the location of the control points.</p>
        <p><strong>Modify control points:</strong>
          Once you have finished a polygon, you can modify individual control
          points. If you click on top of the polygon, the control
          points will appear.
          You can select one of the control points (hold the left mouse button
          down) and move it to a new position. Then click anywhere in the image
          to deselect the polygon. This will also save the modified polygon. </p>
        <p><strong>Delete entire polygon: </strong>Select the polygon. You will
          have the option to delete the polygon. You can only edit polygons that
          you have entered before. You can not delete polygons by other users.</p>
