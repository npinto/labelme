<a href="index.html">LabelMe</a> is a research tool for labeling objects in images. 
</P>

<h2>
<P>
How can you help? Easy!
</P>
</h2>

<P>
Help us build a large collection of annotated images.
</P>

<P>Simply trace the outline of as many different objects from the
image and for as many images as you are able. You can do this for all
of the objects that you want or that you find interesting. You decide
what is the right thing to do. 
</P>

<P>
As soon as you label an image, your annotations will become immediately
available for the scientific community to be used for object
recognition research.
</P>

<h2>
<P>
How do I trace the outline of an object?
</P>
</h2>

Every time you enter the web page or press the 'Show New Image'
button, a new image will be displayed for you to annotate. Your
task is to trace the outline of some of the objects in the image. You
may see that the image already contains some outlines. Those
correspond to outlines done by other people. 
<P>
Here are two examples of traces following the outline of a car:
</P>
<P>This one is bad.</P>
<img src="Icons/badLabelCar.gif" width="222" height="153"> 

<P>
This one is good since the trace tightly follows the outline of the
object.</P>
<img src="Icons/GoodLabelCar.gif" width="222" height="153"> 

<P>
You can trace all of the objects that you want or that you find
interesting. You decide what is the right thing to do. 
</P>


<P>
In order to use the tool, there are <b>only three basic operations</b>
you need to know: draw a polygon (left click), close a polygon (right
click) and delete the current polygon (press 'delete' key). The
operations are very intuitive and you will be used to them with little
practice. Here is some advice on how to use the tool:
</P> 
<P>
<li> To start a polygon, press the left button of your mouse with the
pointer on top of the boundary of the object you want to label. Every
click will add one more point to the polygonal boundary.
</P>
<P>
<li> Right click to close the polygon. You can also close the polygon
by a click on top of the first point. Once the polygon is closed, a
dialog box will appear asking for the name of the object.
</P>
<P>
<li> If you make an error, press the delete key to erase the current
polygon. 
</P>
<P>
The outlines become immediately available for the research community,
so try to correct the errors you make by deleting the object outlines
that you feel are not good. 
</P>

<h2>
<P>
Modifying the outline
</P>
</h2>
<P>
<li> A polygon can be selected by moving the mouse on top of any of
the points of the boundary. When the polygon is active, the dots
become red and the polygonal boundary is shown.
<P>
<li>  You can erase an active polygon by pressing the delete key. You
can change the name of the object by pressing the left button while
you are on top of the polygon.
</P>
<P>
<li> Try to be as accurate as you can. If you make a mistake, press
the delete key to erase the current polygon and start again.
</P>


<P>
If you see an object outline that was already there when the image
appeared and you think that you can do a better job, you can erase it
and redo it. This will help to increase the quality of the
annotations.
</P>

<h2>
<p>Entering a username</p>
</h2>

<p>If you wish, you may enter a username by clicking on the "Change
Username" link, which appears at the top of the page.  A text box will
appear, allowing you to enter a username of your choice.  The username
will then be associated with any new polygons that you create.  This
will allow you to search for annotations that you have done.

<h2>
<P>
Storing the information
</P>
</h2>
<P>
<li> You can stop anytime you want since the information is being
saved each time you press the button that submits a polygon.
</P>

<h2>
<P>
How do I get the most recent copy of the database?
</P>
</h2>
<P>
Getting a copy of the database is easy. All you have to do is label
some images! 
</P>
<P>
Each time you annotate an image, a random number is drawn. If the
 drawn number matches the "winning" number then a new link will appear
 on the main web page directing you to the database and granting you
 access to all of the annotations and images. The annotations will
 also include the ones that you will have just made since the
 annotations become inmediatelly available for download as they are
 entered. So, you will want to make high quality annotations so that
 they are useful to you and the community! 
</P>
<P>
On average, you will have to annotate about 10 images in order to get
access to the database. 
</P>
