<p>News</p>
</h2>

<p><i>18 Nov 2005</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Many new features have been added to
the tool.  You may now enter a username, which will be associated with
any newly created annotations.  You may also download the annotations
directly without playing the randomization game.  Simply click on the
"Downloads" link at the top of the page for more information.  We have
also added searching and browsing capabilities.  To see these
features, please go to the <a href="index.html">introduction</a>
page.

<p><i>24 Aug 2005</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Added a link to the "Matlab Toolbox"
on the main page.  Click on this link to directly access the toolbox
which is used for browsing and searching the image set and annotations.

<p><i>20 Jul 2005</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Added automated download capability.
Click on the "Get Database" link on the main page for more information
on how to obtain the database.  Also added the news page (what you are
reading now).</p>

<h2>
<p>Bug Fixes</p>
</h2>

<p><i>24 Aug 2005</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When finishing the polygon, before
entering a name, if you accidentally click on a vertex that is not at
the end/beginning of the polygon, you get stuck, i.e. cannot enter a
name anymore, cannot delete the segmentation and cannot even get a new
image.  Thanks to Maryam Mahdaviani of University of British Columbia
for pointing this out!</p>
