<font style="color:ff0000; font-size:1.2em;"><b>Note</b></font> 
&nbsp;If the above links do not work, do not worry.  This may be due
to one of the following reasons:
<br />1. The system needs some time to generate the files
(especially for the pop-up book).
Please wait a moment for the system to finish producing
the files and click on the link again.
<br />2. The 3D model starts to be produced when there are at least 5
labeled objects.  Also, the following <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/torralba/labelme/description3D.html">labeling
guidelines</a> may be useful.  Please continue labeling and try again.

1. Install a VRML viewer plugin (we tested <a href="http://www.parallelgraphics.com/products/cortona/download">Cortona</a> and <a href="http://cic.nist.gov/vrml/cosmoplayer.html#AUTOMATIC">Cosmo</a>).
<br />
2. <a id="view_link2">View the 3D model</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mac (Firefox browsers only):</b>
</p>

<p>
1. Install a VRML viewer (try <a href="http://www.octaga.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=17&Itemid=40">Octaga</a>,
<a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/imaging_3d/freewrlvrmlx3dviewer.html">FreeWRL</a>, or 
<a href="http://www.parallelgraphics.com/products/cortona/download">Cortona</a>).
<br />
2. <a id="dload_link2">Download the 3D files</a>.  
<br />
3. After the download finishes, unzip the files and double-click on
the .wrl file.
</p>

<p>
<b>Linux (Firefox browsers only):</b>
</p>

<p>

<font style="font-size:1.5em;">
<b>Navigating the 3D model</b>
</font>
</p>

<p>
While you are in the VRML viewer, you may zoom, rotate, and translate
the 3D scene. Most VRML viewers will have a navigation panel at the
bottom of the viewer. Please consult your VRML viewer's documentation
for more information.

<p>
<font style="font-size:1.5em;">
<b>Make your own 3D pop-up book!</b>
</font>
</p>

<p>
You can have fun away from your computer.  Simply:
</p>

<p>
1. <a id="book_link2">Download the 3D template</a> (if the link is
broken, it means that the book has not been generated yet; please wait
a few minutes and try again).
<br />
2. Cut out the pieces.
<br />
3. Affix the color-coded tabs to the matching color pattern in the ground
pieces.
<br />
4. Voila!  You have your 3D scene.
